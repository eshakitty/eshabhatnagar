# _Saving Nature in Your Community (SNYC)_
**We can do this together!**

Hey there! I'm Esha. Let me tell you a little about the SNYC. The SNYC, or "Save Nature in Your Community",  is a small club that has a goal to spread awareness of nature preservation in communities. The SNYC strives to save nature.

"Why is a random picture of a snail here?" you may be wondering. Actually, I didn't put that there for fun. The SNYC's mascot is a snail! For more information, please visit this website:  https://siddhixjain.github.io/snyc/index.html
  Earth's nature deserves to be taken care of. Even the littlest of things can have a positive effect on the environment. Partaking in "green" activities can contribute in the decrease of pollution on Earth. Remember: Nothing is impossible when done together! 
  
  
  # _Preserve Natural Views_
  
  Caring for the environment not only helps humans and other animals, but it also preserves natural beauty. If you like looking at pretty red roses, or yellow dandelions, then practice these "green" activities!
