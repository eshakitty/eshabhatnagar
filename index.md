**We can do this together!**

Hey there! I'm Esha. Let me tell you a little about the SNYC. The SNYC, or "Save Nature in Your Community",  is a small club that has a goal to spread awareness of nature preservation in communities. The SNYC strives to save nature.

"Why is a random picture of a snail here?" you may be wondering. Actually, I didn't put that there for fun. The SNYC's mascot is a snail! For more information, please visit this website:  https://siddhixjain.github.io/snyc/index.html
 
  # _Preserve Nature_
  
  Earth's nature deserves to be taken care of. Even the littlest of things can have a positive effect on the environment. Partaking in "green" activities can contribute in the decrease of pollution on Earth. We should also take care of animals. Many animals are harmed and even killed, such as snails. Unfortunately, this was by humans. If we work together, we can save nature and the animals living within it!
 
 Caring for the environment not only helps humans and other animals, but it also preserves natural beauty. If you like looking at pretty red roses, or yellow dandelions, then practice these "green" activities!
